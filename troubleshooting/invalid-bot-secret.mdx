# Updating OAuth2 Secret for RestoreCord

If you're facing issues with your bot's integration or need to reset your OAuth2 secret, this guide will assist you through the process. Resetting your OAuth2 secret is often necessary to fix connection and permission issues.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verifying the Correct Bot on Discord Developer Portal">
    Begin by confirming you're updating the correct bot:

    1. Open your web browser and navigate to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    2. Log in with your Discord credentials.
    3. Click on "Applications" and select your Application/Bot.
    4. Verify that the "Client ID" in Discord matches the one in RestoreCord's settings.

    Ensuring the Client ID matches confirms you're editing the correct bot.
