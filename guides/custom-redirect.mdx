# What is a Custom Domain?
A Custom Domain is a domain name that you can use as a redirect_url for your custom bot. This allows you to use your own domain name instead of the RestoreCord domain name.

# Why is it important?
Discord is still able to link all RestoreCord bots together, even if you use a custom bot. This is because RestoreCord previously used the same domain name for all bots. This means that if you use a custom domain, you will be able to hide the fact that you are using RestoreCord.

<Note>Cloudflare is required to use custom domain. If you use something else, he highly suggest switching over to Cloudflare.</Note>

# Step 1 : Adding Cloudflare
<Info>Create an account if required.</Info>

    ```text URL:
      https://example.com/api/callback?code=*&state=*
    ```
    ```text Enter destination URL:
      https://restorecord.com/api/callback?code=$1&state=$2
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  After creating both Page Rules, make sure to configure your custom domain on your `Custom bot` settings without `https://`.
