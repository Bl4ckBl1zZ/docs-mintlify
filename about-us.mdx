Welcome to RestoreCord, your ultimate Discord recovery solution. Founded in 2020, RestoreCord has been providing top-notch services to all kind of Discord users worldwide. Our mission is to help users recover their Discord servers after being nuked, raided, or lost, with ease and reliability.

## New to RestoreCord?

RestoreCord is a Discord recovery service that allows you to restore your Discord Server (along with members & settings) after being nuked, raided, or otherwise lost.

## Where can I use RestoreCord?

RestoreCord has multiple use cases:

- Verification Service
- Server Backup & Restore
    - Server Configuration
    - Channels
    - Messages
    - Permissions
    - Roles

- Light alternate account detection
- And more!

## How does RestoreCord work?

RestoreCord uses Discord's [OAuth2](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) and [API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#add-guild-member) features to allow your server members to verify themselves. Once Authorized, RestoreCord has [special permissions](https://cdn.restorecord.com/static/images/permissions.png) on your members account which allows us to add your members back to your server. This is entirely safe and secure, and we never get access to your members account.
