  <Accordion title="Is RestoreCord safe to use?" icon="shield-check">
    Absolutely! RestoreCord is committed to maintaining your safety. Our system utilizes the [Discord OAuth2](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) feature, which means your interaction with our service is handled by Discordâ€™s OAuth2 page. There, you will authorize the application to place you in the server.
